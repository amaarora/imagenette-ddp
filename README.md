# Distributed Training in PyTorch on ImageNette

This repository contains working code to train on ImageNette using [DISTRIBUTED DATA PARALLEL (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) in PyTorch and [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate).

ðŸ¤— Accelerate - [DOCS](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) | [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)

For a deep-dive into the HF Accelerate package, refer to [Inside Hugging Face's Accelerate!](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/pytorch-image-models/reports/Inside-Hugging-Face-s-Accelerate---Vmlldzo2MzgzNzA). 

To be able to run the scripts, please run the following commands first from the root directory of this repository to download the data: 

```
mkdir data && cd data 
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-160.tgz
tar -xvf imagenette2-160.tgz
```

Now you should have a `data` directory in the repository whose folder structure looks like:

```
data/
â””â”€â”€ imagenette2-160
